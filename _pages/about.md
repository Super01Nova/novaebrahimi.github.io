I am a PhD candidate in the<a href="https://cci.charlotte.edu" target="_blank"> College of Computing and Informatics</a> at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My research investigates the design of immersive virtual learning environments, particularly how spatial and social factors influence user engagement in educational contexts. 
My research systematically identifies design patterns from expert practitioners and translates them into frameworks that guide the development of effective virtual learning spaces. Currently developing computational methods and AI-assisted tools that analyze virtual world interfaces and provide design recommendations for educators and designers. 
I bridge UX research methodologies with architectural spatial design principles to create actionable guidance for building immersive educational systems. My work transforms complex virtual environment research into practical solutions that enhance learning experiences and support strategic implementation across educational institutions and industry training programs.
