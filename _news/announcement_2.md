I am attending <a href="https://2025.democon-conference.org/" target="_blank">Democon 2025</a> in Boca Raton, Florida, where I will present three research papers examining qualitative comparative studies of educational practices in virtual worlds and video conferencing platforms. 

I am honored to be one of only two students selected to receive travel funding for this conference based on my research contributions and academic CV. I look forward to sharing my findings with the educational technology community and engaging with fellow researchers who are advancing the future of digital learning.
