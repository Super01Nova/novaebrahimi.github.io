I am attending the <a href="https://2025.fie-conference.org/" target="_blank">IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference 2025</a> in Nashville, Tennessee, where I will present a paper on effective teaching strategies in virtual worlds for engineering and computing education.
This research is part of my ongoing work on design patterns aimed at enhancing learning experiences in virtual worlds. I look forward to engaging with educational innovation research and reconnecting with scholars from last year's conference.
