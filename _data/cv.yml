      #year: 2021 - Present
      description:
        - Developed the Socio-Spatial Embodiment Model for virtual learning environments through mixed-methods research, published across 5 venues (FIE 2022, 2024, 2025; ACM ISS 2023; Virtual Worlds Journal)
        - Conducted comprehensive qualitative research including in-depth educator interviews and student focus groups, to identify design strategies and interface patterns in virtual world education
        - Designed a psychometric instrument to measure integrated student experiences of place, presence, and community in virtual learning environments
        - Developed computational taxonomy of virtual world interface patterns using computer vision, machine learning clustering, and systematic pattern analysis to inform educational design decisions
        - Applied interdisciplinary expertise combining user experience research, human-computer interaction, architectural design principles, and educational technology to solve complex interface usability challenges in virtual environments
        - Developed systematic design pattern identification for desktop virtual worlds, transitioning from qualitative insights to computational analysis for scalable educational technology improvements
        - Led teaching assistant teams for HCI, Rapid Prototyping, and Interaction Design Studio courses while conducting doctoral research on virtual environment design
